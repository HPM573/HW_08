# Homework Assignment 8


**Note**: Before working on this homework, review the [solution](https://github.com/HPM573/HW_3_Solution) 
to Homework Assignment 3 to make sure your model is correctly set up. 
You may choose to continue working on the model you created for the the Homework Assignment 3, 
or on the model provided in the [solution](https://github.com/HPM573/HW_3_Solution).  


**Problem 1: Confidence Interval (Weight 1).**
Print the 95% t confidence intervals for the expected reward and the probability of loss 
(assuming that the probabiliy of head is 50% in each coin flip). 
You can use 1,000 simulated games to calculate these confidence intervals.

**Problem 2: Interpretation of Confidence Intervals (Weight 1):** 
How do you interpret the confidence intervals you reported in Problem 1?

**Problem 3: How many simulation runs are needed? (Weight 1):** 
Suppose that we would like the half length of our estiamted expected reward to be at most $2. How many simulation runs should we obtain?

**Problem 4: Casino Owner versus Gamblers (Weight 3).** Analyze this game from the perspectives of:
1. The casino owner who gets to play this game many times, and
2. A gambler who gets to play this game only 10 times.

Both are interested in knowing their expected reward and the uncertainty in your estimates. 
Report the appropriate interval (confidence or projection) to describe the uncertainty in these 
estimates and interpret these intervals for them.
